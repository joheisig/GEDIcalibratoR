## Check and Install Notes

The package should install without errors or warnings. Three NOTEs are known of:

1. from installed package size of 23.8Mb 
2. from non-standard file 'README.Rmd' - here demo data is stored to speed up examples and the vignette.
3. from detected possible problems related to non-visible bindings for global variables

## Introduction And Motivation

The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission aims at quantifying vegetation structure and Above Ground Biomass (ABG) to help better understand the global carbon cycle. The instrument is a space-borne full-waveform LiDAR sensor with a 25 meter circular footprint. It was launched in 2019 and carries out millions of measurements every day ever since. The data is a great asset for vegetation scientists and serves as a consistent alternative to expensive and often inaccessible airborne LiDAR (ALS).
GEDI's mean location error in the version 2 product is reported to be 10.2 meters (Dubayah et al. 2021). The relationship between GEDI and other remotely sensed data, e.g. multi-spectral or ALS, may be improved through location correction. The idea is to calibrate its footprint location using reference ALS-based digital elevation models (DEMs) or digital surface models (DSMs). This can significantly reduce the error between GEDI and its reference and benefit statistical models down the analysis pipeline. 

The `GEDIcalibratoR` package provides functionality to 

1. identify and download publicly available ALS, DEM and DSM tiles
2. generate a normalized relative height model
3. set up two types of calibration grids
4. extract and summarize calibration measures
5. identify and apply the best suitable spatial shift for a GEDI orbit
6. visualize the improvement

## Limitations

Currently `GEDIcalibratoR` only provides reference data downloads from public ALS data archives of three German states, namely Northrhine-Westphalia, Thuringia, and Saxony. This approach follows the assumption, that GEDI's location error applies an entire orbit, as it originates from a constant spatial shift of the flight path. 

## GEDI Data

GEDI data can be acquired from [NASA EarthData](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=C1908348134-LPDAAC_ECS) or through platforms such aas Google Earth Engine. To use it within `R` and `GEDIcalibratoR` it should be stored as and imported from a geo-referenced vector file (e.g. `.gpgk` or `.shp`) and have a projected coordinate reference system. In this demo, `gedi` is read using `sf`. It stores two GEDI orbits containing relative height measurements (`rh1-rh99`), the source file name (`file`), and an `Ã¬d` column enumerating observations per file.

```{r}
library(GEDIcalibratoR)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(mapview)

gedi = system.file("demodata/gedi.gpkg", package = "GEDIcalibratoR") |> st_read()
head(names(gedi))
table(gedi$file)
```

## Retrieving ALS reference tiles

We intersect GEDI points with ALS tile grids to identify suitable tiles for download. `intersect_tiles2download()` adds a column `n_obs` that contains the number of intersecting points per tile. This is helpful for prioritizing and to keep download volume small. In this example we will only use the three most intersected tiles for each German state instead of a total of 881 tiles. Download tiles may also be filtered by defining argument `region` or by filtering `tiles` by year of acquisition.

```{r intersect}
tiles = intersect_tiles2download(gedi_obs = gedi, quiet = T)
nrow(tiles)

tiles = tiles |> group_by(state) |> slice_max(n_obs, n = 3)
```

Alternatively you may select tiles for download interactively. The following command will open a map showing all available tiles. 

```{r select, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
tiles = select_tiles2download(gedi_obs = gedi)
```

Below screenshots show the `shiny` application used to select tiles manually.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("demodata/select_tiles.png", package = "GEDIcalibratoR"))
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("demodata/select_tiles_zoom.png", package = "GEDIcalibratoR"))
```

Regardless of how suitable tiles were identified, they can be downloaded using `download_tiles()`. Here we choose to download both the DEM and the DSM. They can later be used to derive a relative height model (RHM), which will serve as reference for GEDI's relative height metrics. 

> Note: In the following several steps are skipped in this demo, including the download (~160 MB), the creation of RHMs and raster value extraction. Preprocessed data (`grid_ext`) is loaded instead. Execute this vignette manually to download and preprocess on your local machine.

```{r download, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
td = tempdir()
down_tiles = download_tiles(tiles, what = c("DEM","DSM"), dir = td)
```

Paths of downloaded files are stored in `down_tiles`. Next, `make_rhm()` takes them as inputs, processes RHMs and writes them to the same directory.

```{r rhms, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
rhm_paths = make_rhm(down_tiles, overwrite_if_exists = T)
```

## Location Calibration

Now that reference data preparation is complete we want to extract raster values at multiple potential locations. We can construct two types of calibration grids, rectangular or circular. Rectangular grids are simply defined by a sequence of `steps` starting at the original GEDI location. Circular grids consist of rings spaced according to `steps`. A second parameter, `n_circle_elements`, sets the number of points per ring. In the following two examples we spatially subset `gedi` using the extent of the `tiles` we downloaded. Note that you can copy certain variables from `gedi` to use them for calibration later.

```{r grids}
steps = c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12)
vars = c("file","id","rh98")

gedi_rect = gedi |> 
  st_filter(tiles) |>
  cal_grid_rect(steps = steps, 
                copy_GEDI_vars = vars)

gedi_circ = gedi |> 
  st_filter(tiles) |> 
  cal_grid_circle(steps = steps, 
                  n_circle_elements = 12, 
                  copy_GEDI_vars = vars)
```

Check the two grid patterns we created for each `gedi` observation:

```{r grid_plot}
#| fig.align="center",
#| fig.show="hold",
#| fig.width=3.5,
#| fig.height = 2,
#| out.width="100%"
par(mar = c(0,1,1,.5), mfrow=c(1,2))
filter(gedi_rect, id == gedi_rect$id[1]) |> st_geometry() |> plot(main = "rectangular")
filter(gedi_circ, id == gedi_circ$id[1]) |> st_geometry() |> plot(main = "circular")
```

To compare GEDI measurements with reference data we need to extract the latter at potentially better suitable locations of the former. `cal_extract()` only requires a list of RHM file paths and the calibration grid. The default buffer (12.5 meters) matches the GEDI footprint.

```{r extract, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
grid_ext = cal_extract(rhm_paths, gedi_circ, buffer = 12.5)
```

> Note: Here we load `grid_ext` as a  pre-processed file.

```{r load_ext}
grid_ext = readRDS(system.file("demodata/grid_ext.rds", package = "GEDIcalibratoR")) 
```

For further evaluation we exclude zeros in the reference data. These may occur in areas where DEM and DSM are equal. 

```{r}
grid_ext = filter(grid_ext, ext_value > 0)
```

Summary statistics are then calculated for each GEDI orbit and shift. In this example we have one original position plus 48 shifted positions for two orbits resulting in 98 rows in the output of `shift_stats()`. Results can be visualized using `plot_shift_stats()`. Plots indicate, that the RMSE between `rh98` and ALS reference data can be improved by 0.84 and 0.66 meters, respectively. 

```{r}
#| fig.width = 7,
#| fig.height = 4

shifts = shift_stats(grid_ext, cal_var = "rh98")
plot_shift_stats(shifts)
```

Finally, we want to visualize the difference between the original data and applying the best suitable spatial shift per orbit. Two simple helper functions enable filtering for these two special cases, `get_best_shift()` and `get_no_shift()`. Calibrated GEDI data can be plotted versus its reference through `plot_calibration()`. You can create plots with single shifts or add a second shift as reference. Here we demonstrate the comparison of the best shift versus no shift. RMSE labels take into account all available observations (across files). If you are satisfied with the result you can `apply_shift()` to your original GEDI data.

```{r}
#| fig.width = 7,
#| fig.height = 4
best_shift = get_best_shift(grid_ext, shifts)
no_shift = get_no_shift(grid_ext, shifts)

color = c("forestgreen", "firebrick4")
plot_calibration(best_shift, label = "Best Shift", color = color[1])
plot_calibration(no_shift, label = "No Shift", color = color[2])
plot_calibration(best_shift, no_shift,  label = c("Best","Ref"), color = color)
```

By combining two shift options in one pane the third scatter plot shows the effect of the calibration effort for each GEDI observation included. A significant reduction in RMSE was achieved.

The output of `get_best_shift()` can be re-joined with the original GEDI measurement data and used in downstream analysis.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
#| fig.width=7,
#| out.width = "100%"
GEDI_calibrated = apply_shift(gedi, best_shift)

GEDI_calibrated_subset = st_filter(GEDI_calibrated, tiles)

mapview(tiles, alpha.regions = 0, color="blue") +
  mapview(gedi_circ, alpha = 0) +
  mapview(GEDI_calibrated, col.regions = color[1], alpha = 1) 
```

Zoom into this map to find the selected ALS tile footprints, the circular calibration grid, the calibrated GEDI locations and the original ones (hidden by default).

## Discussion

GEDI data, being acquired by a space-borne instrument, comes with a trade-off. On the one side it measures vegetation structure with a near-global coverage, delivering consistent data in areas without accessible ALS data. In turn it prone larger (height) measurement errors compared to ALS. This demo shows how GEDI data may be calibrated by reducing its location error. 

The analysis found different optimal locations for the two example GEDI orbits. Their RMSE when compared to an ALS reference could be reduced by 0.58 (~19 %) and 0.47 (~9 %) meters, respectively. That is a significant improvement of the original data and will likely have a positive effect on further statistical models. It should be noted, however, that this result only considered few ALS reference tile and may vary when including more data. Further, this analysis used pre-filtered GEDI observations (day of year, time of day, quality flag) to receive the most promising and sensitive measurements. Including all available observations may impact the calibration effect.
Future efforts should investigate the effect of this pre-processing method on GEDI-based estimates of above-ground carbon stock or forest structure.
